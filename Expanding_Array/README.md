# Expanding an Array

## Prompt:

Write a function that accepts an int array and the arrayâ€™s size as arguments. The function should create a new array that is twice the size of the argument array. The function should copy the contents of the argument array to the new array and initialize the unused elements of the second array with 0. The function should return a pointer to the new array.

Function is demonstrated by reading an integer N from imput, then reading N integers from a file named "data"

Note: data.txt is a text file with 50 integers.
