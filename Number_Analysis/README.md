# Number Analysis

Write a program that asks the user for a file name. Assume the file contains a series of numbers, each written on a separate line. The program should read the contents of the file into an array then display the following data:

• The lowest number in the array

• The highest number in the array

• The total of the numbers in the array

• The average of the numbers in the array

To test the program, you can download the file numbers.txt from the book’s companion website.
